Do not explain your actions in code comments or function names.  Never add unecessary commentary like "foo_improved" in function names.  Do not leave unecessary reasoning in your code comments.  

Never add requirements without being asked (e.g. adding a README for no reason)

NEVER add unecessary failover logic nor backwards compatibility when fixing methods

If you have code that looks right but get linting errors, stop and ask me to re-build it instead of trying alternatives.
